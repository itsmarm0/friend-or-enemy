“A shared space management system that suggests tables to students based on availability, priorities, and friendship/enmity relationships, managing seating and waiting queues efficiently.”

# Project Review
This program is designed to implement a shared space management system (similar to a university website). The system suggests suitable tables to each student upon login, allowing them to choose one. When a student leaves, the system checks the waiting queue for that table. Based on students’ priorities and their friendship/enmity relationships, the system aims to provide the best possible suggestions.
